## It is multiclass classification problem, where price range of the mobile phones are given below:
#### 0 - Low
#### 1 - Medium
#### 2 - High
#### 3 - Very High

## info :
- Here we have two dataset __train.csv__ & __test.csv__ where __test.csv__ doesn't have price range. We applied different-2 model and Trained  all model 
and compare the performance of the models. Select among the  best model based on the performance. After then applied best model to __test.csv__ dataset 
and predicted  the price range of __test.csv__.

## Performance of the   Models :

| Sr.           | Model              | Accuracy(in %)  |
| ------------- |:------------------:| ---------:|
| 1.            | Logistic Regression|   95        |
| 2.            | Decision Tree      |   83     |
| 3.            | Random Forest      |    $1     |
| 4.            | Gaussian NB        |    $1     |
| 5.            |      SVM           |    95%    |
